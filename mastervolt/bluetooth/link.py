"""Building blocks shared by the BMS and balancer Bluetooth workers.

* `Wakeup`      - an event that threads can set and an asyncio task can wait for, with a timeout
* `Supervisor`  - runs a worker's coroutine in its own thread/event loop and keeps it alive: it restarts the worker after a
                  crash, and a monitor thread replaces a worker thread that has died or whose event loop hangs
* client helpers - creating a Bleak client, opening the link with hard deadlines, disconnecting safely
* `scan_for`    - find the wanted devices in one scan that ends as soon as they have all been seen

Every Windows Bluetooth call gets a hard deadline (`asyncio.wait_for`): a hung WinRT call would otherwise freeze a whole
worker loop (CLAUDE.md). A client that connected but failed later is always disconnected.
