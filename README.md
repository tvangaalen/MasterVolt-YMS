# MasterVolt YMS

**Mastervolt Energy v2.0.2** — a private web app (installable iPhone PWA) that monitors and controls a boat's
Mastervolt electrical system and its DALY battery management, from a Windows PC on the boat's LAN.

- **MasterBus** over the Mastervolt USB Link: CombiMaster (shore power, inverter, charger), Solar ChargeMaster,
  Alpha Pro alternator regulator, Mass chargers, MasterShunts and the Yanmar engine ECU interface.
- **DALY Bluetooth** for the three house-battery BMS units (`BATTERY 1`–`3`) and the three balancers (`DL-BAL1`–`3`).
- **FastAPI** backend (the `mastervolt` package), a no-build front end in `static/`, SQLite measurement history, local HTTPS.

**The complete guide is the [manual](docs/MANUAL.md)** (also served by the app at `/manual`): what every screen shows, how
every number is obtained, Float protection, the Bluetooth design, files, API, operations, troubleshooting and the developer
guide. Release history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Protocol findings and field maps: [docs/hardware-notes.md](docs/hardware-notes.md).

## Pages

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Control panel** | Sources, Storage and Loads tiles with live V/A/W and an arc-gauge SOC; ON/OFF controls; Motor / Anchor / Sail / Marina modes (the last one applied is remembered server-side and highlighted for every browser); shore-power AC limit; `INV` and `SUP`; Engine ECU power with a safety confirmation |
| **BMS** | The three batteries side by side with their balancers: SOC gauge, V/A/°C and per-cell balancer bars in each tile; a table with status, balancing, cell voltages (BMS and balancer) and Charge/Discharge controls; Set SOC (curve, 100% or a manual percentage); separate Refresh BMS and Refresh BAL |
| **History** | Sources, Storage, Loads and Alarms charts from a server-side cache, with 4 h … All, Custom and Zoom ranges and a donut with exact totals per tab; a Reports tab with the battery health report |
| **Settings** | Default AC limit, Float protection thresholds, refresh/retry intervals, history retention, database status, a link to the manual |

## Run

Requirements: Windows with the Mastervolt USB Link and a Bluetooth adapter, Python 3.12 or newer, OpenSSL for the certificate set-up.

```powershell
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.\start_mastervolt_server.cmd        # HTTPS on the private LAN address, port 8000 (first-time phone set-up: docs/local-https.md)
```

`.\run.ps1` starts a plain-HTTP development server on all interfaces (trusted networks only). The server needs exclusive use of
the MasterBus USB Link and the Bluetooth radio: close MasterAdjust and the diagnostic tools first. Before the first start after
changing control code, check the mappings with `py -m tools.show_fields` (`engine_ecu` must show `verified True`, address `3AE394`, field `43`).

## Safety model

- Only hardware-verified MasterBus fields are used; nothing is guessed at run time.
- Every control writes, reads back and verifies. Engine ECU OFF (and Alternator OFF) need an explicit confirmation whose default
  is *keep it ON*; no operating mode ever switches the ECU off.
- DALY writes go through one Bluetooth priority queue, with a pre-change backup in `backups/`.
- **Float protection** runs on the server every 3 s and forces the charging sources to Float once any single BMS cell reaches the
  trigger (default 3500 mV), back to Bulk once every cell is at or below the resume level (default 3420 mV). It reads cell voltage
  only from the three DALY BMSes, only trusts fresh data, never starts on missing data and holds Float rather than resuming blind.
  When it starts, every battery's SOC is set to 100% once.
- The server listens only on a private RFC1918 address (or localhost). Nothing is published to the internet.

Runtime data (not for version control): `data/history.sqlite3`, `backups/`, `logs/`, `reports/`, `user_settings.json`,
`certs/*-key.pem`. See `.gitignore`.

## Tests

```powershell
py -m tests.run_all          # about two and a half minutes; no hardware is touched
py -m tests.run_all quick    # without the slow simulations
```

The golden tests prove that controls, the energy model, Float protection, DALY decoding, the history and the HTTP API still
behave exactly like the hardware-verified 1.22.2 release; the simulation tests run the real Bluetooth workers and the whole
application against a simulated USB Link and Bluetooth stack.

## Development

Python is formatted with black and checked with ruff (`pyproject.toml`); the front end with prettier (`.prettierrc.json`).
These are development tools only and are not needed to run the server. The release procedure, the rules that must not be broken
and how to add a setting, field, control or page are in the manual, chapter 9.
