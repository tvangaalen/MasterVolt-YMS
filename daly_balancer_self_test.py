"""Non-hardware self-test for DalyBalancerService using a simulated Bluetooth layer (fake bleak).

Covers: complete-status publishing (no half-read balancers in the history), one retry for unanswered commands,
static device information read once, GATT time-outs, per-balancer exponential backoff, the crash-proof supervisor,
the stall watchdog (rescan, worker rebuild, wedged flag and recovery) and the manual/full refresh semantics.
